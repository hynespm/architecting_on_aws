## Author: Patrick Hynes

As a certified AWS instructor, I deliver a course called Architecting on AWS. And this repository is a collecton of scripts and templates I used when delivering that course.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains materials organised to align with the module structure used. Folders are used to organise materials.
Subfolders of each module organise the repository further. The objective being to aide reuse and allow for new contributions to be easy organised
